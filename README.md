# Time-Lapse-Video-from-normal-video
## This is shell script to convert all the still videos in source directory to time-lapse video

#### Step1: Change the value of *"input_path"* to the source directory (still video directory)

#### Step2: Change the value of *"output_path"* to the destination directory (directory where you want to store time-lapse videos)

#### Two settings are given (one is commented in line 14). Use whichever you like

#### Step3: Use the command *"chmod +x time_lapse_video.sh"* to make the script executable

#### Step4: Run *"./time_lapse_video.sh"*

#### Done!!
